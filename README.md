WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE?


Our team created the game Who Wants to Be a Millionaire for our project. Our team leader
is Tanisha Batta and our team members are Tanisha Batta and Shreya Rajan. Who Wants to
Be a Millionaire is a game show where users answer 10 multiple-choice questions for a
chance to win 1 million dollars. If a user answers a question right, they move to the next
round and their potential prize amount increases. If a user answers all 10 questions right, they
win the game, but if a user answers even one question wrong, they are eliminated and lose
the game. Afterwards, theyâ€™re taken to a leaderboard with their updated score and rank as
well as a list of the players and their ranks. The team leader, Tanisha Batta, was in charge of
creating the questions and handling the overall design and animation of the game. I, Shreya
Rajan, wrote the code for the leaderboard, login and register pages, and ensured scores and
prize amounts updated after each round. We used HTML, CSS, and PHP to create the
website for our game. We also used PHP to handle form processing and user
sessions/cookies. Finally, we used tables and forms to create the multiple-choice questions.
We also added login validation so usernames must be more than 5 characters and passwords
must meet a minimum requirement of 8 characters with an uppercase character and a special
character. We added animation to the questions as well for you to check out.
